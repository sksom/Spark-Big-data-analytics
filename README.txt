"BigData_HW2_Shashank_Kumar_Som.zip" contains the solution for the assignment-2. Inside the "BigData_HW2_Shashank_Kumar_Som.zip" there are 4 folders named Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, one for each corresponding question.

The assignment-2 has been done using Scala+Spark on databricks platform. 


Uploading the Input data files on databricks:

The input files are stored on the DBFS(DataBricks File System).
How to upload datafile to DBFS?
1. Log in to your community account(Free account).
2. Create a new cluster from the link on your welcome page's 'New' section.
3. When the cluster is up and running, click on the 'Data' option in the left pane and click on the '+' sign on the right side of tables pane.
4. Choose file(selected by default) in the data source drop down list and drag and drop your file in the space provided below. Do not forget to note down the "Address/location" of the file generated by the databricks because this is address that is used in the script to load data file into the RDD or DataFrame. 




Running the Scala scripts:

To run the code on databricks, make a new notebook from the link on your welcome page's 'New' section, copy the code from the scripts provided in the respective folders and paste into the notebook you created and then go to the top right corner and click on the 'PLAY' icon to choose 'Run Cell' from the drop down menu that appears.


Output:

Each of the folders(Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4) has two folders, a folder named "script" containing the script for each question in a seperate .scala file(which you can also open using notepad++) and "output_snapshots" folder contain snaphots of the results for the respective question.


NOTE: If you want to get the output in a .txt file from databricks(which most probably won't be needed as databricks provides the output in the output console below immediately after the script is executed), the command is included and commented out in the question 1 script in the secon-last line and to download that output file follow the instructions below:

Instructions: On the Community Edition(free edition) you need to copy and paste "https://community.cloud.databricks.com/files/my-stuff/your_text_file_name.txt?o=######" into your browser to start output text file download where the number after o= is the same as in your Community Edition URL.
